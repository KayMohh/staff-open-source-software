# **Outlines Utility Library**

This repository demonstrates how I approach open-source development, focusing on simplicity, consistency, and clarity. Using Python, I've created a small utility library that complements the functionality of .txt's **Outlines** project. The goal is to extend some of the guided generation features and ensure easy integration into larger applications.

## **Project Overview**

This library provides reusable functions for working with structured documents in **Outlines**, including:

- **Document Parsing and Validation**: Functions for parsing different document formats (Markdown, LaTeX, HTML) and ensuring they meet specific structural criteria.
- **Content Generation Helpers**: Tools to simplify the process of dynamically generating content for documentation or reports based on user inputs.
- **Community Contributions**: The library is designed with an open API for future community contributions, allowing users to submit extensions and improvements.

## **Getting Started**

To get started, clone the repository and follow the installation steps.

### **Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/outlines-utility-lib.git
cd outlines-utility-lib
pip install -r requirements.txt
